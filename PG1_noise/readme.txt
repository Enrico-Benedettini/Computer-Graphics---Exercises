Task PG1.2.1: 1D noise

We compute the formula with the provided values
We had to modularize the hash to get one of the twelve gradients because the values given by the hash_poly function gave value in 0..288 

Task PG1.3.1: FBM 1D

We simply implement the sum that is described in the given formula.

Task PG1.4.1: 

We simply repeat what we aleady for the 1D noise but with 2d vectors and we follow the steps provided in the images.

Task PG1.4.2: 

We repeat what we did in 1.3.1 but renaiming one variable.

Task PG1.4.3: 

We did the same as for 1.4.2 but we now evaluate the absolute value of the octaves.

Task PG1.5.1: 

We translate the provided formulas for Wood, Map and Marble to code

Task PG1.6.1: 

There, we first generate the terrain by computing the vertices normalizing the gx and gy based on the grid width and height, and reducing them by 0.5 to fit in the [-0.5,0.5] square. As suggested, we check that if the heigth is less than the Water Level, we set the normals to [0,0,1].
Finally we push the faces [va,vb,vc] and [vb,vd,vc].
Then, we copy paste for the camera and blinn-phong model and we set the shininess and material color based on the heigth:
 - if below the level of water, we set shininess to 30. and material color to water
 - otherwise, we set shininess to 2. and material color to be interpolated between the grass and the mountain
